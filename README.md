# Year-End Tournament of Imagination (YETI) Challenge 2021

Welcome to our first Year-End Tournament of Imagination (YETI) Challenge! 

We'll have five days of code-related challenges, starting on December 13 and ending on December 17. Challenges will be related to algorithms and data-handling, and each can be accomplished in <50 lines of code. The winner will get bragging rights for a year and their name on the YETI Plaque. Monetary prizes up to $100 will be up for grabs as well.

Each day's challenge will build off the previous days, and instructions will appear in this repository. Additional information may be found in the #yeti channel of the department-wide Slack. 

Any graduate student or undergraduate major in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UTK can participate. If you are in a research position, please check with your advisor before participating.

To get started, you'll fork this repository. You must write any software you use, and put it in your fork in a dedicated folder for that day. Any programming language is acceptable. In the end, you'll be asked to submit a pull request to the upstream repository using special instructions that you'll receive in due time. Anyone who completes the challenge on the last day (before 11:59pm) will be in the running -- among those people, the one with the best code as judged by the organizers will win. If no one finishes on that day, the first person to correctly submit will be the winner.

Good luck!
