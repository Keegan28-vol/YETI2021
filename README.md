# Year End Technical Challenge 2021

Welcome to our first Year End Technical Challenge! 

We'll have five days of code-related challenges, starting on December 13 and ending on December 17. The winner will get bragging rights for a year, their name on the YETC Plaque, and a cash prize. 

Each day's challenge will build off the previous days. You'll receive the instructions for the day's challenge in the #YETC channel of the department-wide Slack. 

To get started, you'll fork this repository. You must write any software you use, and put it in your fork. In the end you'll be asked to submit a pull request with the code you used to solve the challenges. Anyone who completes the challenge on the last day will be in the running -- among those people, the one with the best code will win. If no one finishes on the first day, the first person to submit will be the winner.

Good luck!
