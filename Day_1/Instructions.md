# Day 1

Start by cracking the entry password for the challenge. Find a 4-character alphanumeric string that corresponds to an md5 hash of `4002f685108db38f1af9965f3bc869eb`. Write a program to crack this password. You can use brute force or use any technique you'd like. Go to `tiny.utk.edu/{that string}` (without any brackets). Download the file, which contains some secret data.
